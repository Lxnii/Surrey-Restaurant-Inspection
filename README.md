# Surrey-Restaurant-Inspection

### Android App, Health Inspection of Restaurant in Surrey 

• My teammates and I implemented an Android application through Android Studio.

• We develop iteratively through agile software development and version manage the app through Git.

• Use the Surry Open Data API to get real-time Surry restaurant health data.

• Users can choose to view the health check information of different restaurants in the list and map, which is convenient for browsing all restaurants and nearby restaurants.

• The app is also internationalized and supports automatic switching between English, French, Czech and Turkish according to the user's language preference.
